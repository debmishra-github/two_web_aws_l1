# Texas Water Observatory (TWO) 

TWO is a state-of-the-art distributed network of field observatories in the Gulf Coast of Texas, developed to better understand the water, energy, and carbon cycles across the critical zone (encompassing aquifers, soils, plants, and atmosphere) at different spatiotemporal scales. TWO infrastructure spans common land uses in this region including (traditional/aspirational cultivated agriculture, rangelands, native prairie, bottomland hardwood forest, and coastal wetlands).
