The ranch is located in a transition zone between the northeastern portion of the central Rio Grande Plain and the Gulf Prairie and Marshes. The climate is subtropical with hot summers and mild winters. Extended cold periods are rare. The growing season is approximately 300 days in length. Annual precipitation averages 716 mm, of which 70% falls in April through September. Three out of five years receive less than average rainfall so precipitation is erratic and droughts are often severe.",
